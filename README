INSTALL:

autostatus is using CMake build system, so after extract the tarball, go to the directory, then run
   > cmake .
   > make install

sometimes you need root privilege to install the plugin.

if you wish to install the plugin other than "/usr/local/", you can use cmake to configure, like this,
   > cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .

after install the plugin, you may need to manually set up the rules in configuration file. the default configuration file is ./autostatus.config, you can simply copy it to pidgin configuration directory.

the configuration file format is very restricted, so, please follow the following format:

   ${ip address 0}/${netmask 0}
   ${prompt 0}
   ${ip address 1}/${netmask 1}
   ${prompt 1}
   ${ip address 2}/${netmask 2}
   ${prompt 2}

there shouldnt be any space/empty line before, after or between.
