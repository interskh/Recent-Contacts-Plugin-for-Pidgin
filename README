== INSTALL ==

On Linux, recent_contacts is using CMake build system, so after extracting the
tarball, go to the directory, then run
  > cmake .  make install

sometimes you need root privilege to install the plugin.

if you wish to install the plugin other than "/usr/local/", you can
use cmake to configure, like this,
  > cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .  make install

or you can manually install
  > cmake .
  > make
  > cp librecent_contacts.so ~/.purple/plugins


In order to build the plugin for Windows an already-compiled source tree of
Pidgin is required. Please see the Pidgin for Windows Build Instructions
(https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/BuildingWinPidgin) for details.

After that you need to create a file named "local.mak" that points to the
Pidgin source tree, e.g.:
  > PIDGIN_TREE_TOP=$(PLUGIN_TOP)/../../pidgin-2.10.11
Now you can build the plugin:
  > make -f Makefile.mingw

== NOTES ==
The implementation of Recent Contacts is by using a group called
"Recent Contact". When a new conversation starts or a conversation
terminates, it pushes the contact to the recent contact group and set
it to be "show when offline". If the buddy is already in thte recent
contact, we simply put it to the top of list.
